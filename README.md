 We have not included a retry button in the pause menu as the gamplay is only three minutes long and It was a design desicion that the inclusion of a retry will be would affect the short game loop.

 We are not showing the money bar or score during gameplay as we would like the player to not know how much they can earn from each task so thae will prioritize those over the other tasks. 

The cutscene is set to unskipable as the click any button to skip is breaking the spawingn if the right map during the packaging of the game.
